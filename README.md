```js
let copyText = e.target.previousElementSibling
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText.value);
```
-how to add an stlysheet and add to html and change the color of placeholder,because it is not possible to get that directly with JS:

const style = document.createElement("style")
style.type = "text/css"
const {
  sheet
} = document.head.appendChild(style)

const rule = sheet.insertRule("::placeholder {}")
const placeholderStyle = sheet.rules[rule].style;
 placeholderStyle.color = "#dc3545";
```
-how to use  pseudo-class "not" with "hover":

```css
.nav-link:hover:not(.sign-up-button) {
  color: var(--darkViolet) !important;
}
```
